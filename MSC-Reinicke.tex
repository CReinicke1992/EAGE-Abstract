\section{Introduction}

Blending is a recent seismic acquisition design, which allows seismic shots to interfere. 



Current processing techniques are not capable to deal with blended data. Consequently, the blended data must be deblended (separated) as if they were acquired in a conventional way. I propose a new acquisition design based on blended crossline sources. 


In contrast to existing blended-acquisition designs that only blend in 2D (inline direction and time), this design blends sources in 3D (inline direction, crossline direction and time). For this reason I propose a 3D deblending method.
