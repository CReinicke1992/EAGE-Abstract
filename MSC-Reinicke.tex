\section{Introduction}

Blending is a recent seismic acquisition design, which allows seismic sources to interfere. Currently, in marine seismic acquisition sources are blended in the inline direction, i.e. the data are blended in 2D (inline direction and time). In a pre-processing step the blended data must be deblended (separated) as if they were acquired in a conventional way. 

In this abstract I propose to blend marine sources in the crossline direction. Thus, in combination with the movement of the vessel the data are blended in 3D (crossline direction, inline direction and time). 3D blending allows to design many new acquisition configurations. Figure \ref{fig:Intro-Configs} shows a conventional acquisition design compared to one possible 3D blended acquisition design. In the following I will refer to the acquisition design in Figure \ref{fig:Intro-Config-Xline-Blended} as wide crossline source array. Both acquisition designs in Figure \ref{fig:Intro-Configs} acquire the same area. However, the wide crossline source array requires less equipment and benefits from a more symmetric distribution of sources and receivers.

Existing deblending methods are designed for 2D blended data. Therefore, I will introduce a 3D deblending method.

\section{Method and/or Theory}

\subsection{2D inspiration}

The presented 3D deblending method is inspired by the 2D method of \citet{Mahdad-Deblending-Method}. The method of \citet{Mahdad-Deblending-Method} assumes that the blended data are acquired with random firing-time delays. The blended data, $\mathbf{P}_{bl}$, are sorted in a so-called pseudo-deblended data matrix, $\mathbf{P}_{ps}$, which has as many rows as receivers and as many columns as sources. Note that these data matrices refer to single frequency components. In the pseudo-deblended data matrix, $\mathbf{P}_{ps}$, the seismic response corresponding to one source is coherent. The responses of the other blended sources is broken up into incoherent events. Therefore, the method of \citet{Mahdad-Deblending-Method} uses a 2D $f$-$k$ filter and thresholding to remove the energy of the blended sources in an iterative approach.
